# ML
Machine Learning project about prediction ICU admissions following an operation

# Deep Learning Algorithm 
We will conduct this research for the company Chipsoft. Chipsoft is an Amsterdam based software company which develops software for the healthcare sector. Chipsoft will deliver us a dataset from which we can derive information about patients during a surgery. The umbrella term PDMS will be used to refer to the data. PDMS stands for Patient Data Management System. 

## The research question will be:
##### How does the architecture of the Neural Network influence whether someone will end up at the intensive care unit or will have complications following surgery given their PDMS?

## Sub-questions:
### Theoretical:
    1. What is a patient data management system?
    2. How does a deep learning machine algorithm work?

### In Practice:
    1. Can we find correlations in the data that can give us useful insights?
    2. Can we provide the sergeants with insights derived from the data during the surgery
